Network Packet Capture Project

## Objective
To demonstrate basic cybersecurity and network analysis skills by capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Virtual Machine (Ubuntu 22.04 on VMware/VirtualBox)
- Command Terminal (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`)

## Process
1. Set up a Linux virtual machine.
2. Installed required updates.
3. Launched Wireshark and selected the active network interface.
4. Captured live packet data to observe protocol communication.
5. Stopped the capture and reviewed packet details.

## Findings
- Successfully captured live network traffic.
- Identified communication over standard protocols (ex. TCP, UDP).
- Demonstrated ability to configure monitoring tools and analyze basic traffic.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Virtualization environment setup
- Network monitoring
- Basic cybersecurity understanding
- Linux command line usage
- Technical documentation

## Next Steps
- Configure alerts or filters
- Attempt capturing a simulated attack or suspicious traffic
- Explore log monitoring tools
